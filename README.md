### Hi there 👋

I'm **Ashtin**, a developer and product-minded engineer based in Cape Town, working at the intersection of web applications, platform reliability, and self-hosted systems.

By day I work as a **Product Support Engineer**, helping keep a global SaaS platform stable, scalable, and easy to use. Outside of work I enjoy building full-stack projects with **Next.js, React, Node.js and SQL**, often deploying them on **Raspberry Pi / Linux** just to understand systems end-to-end.

I like solving practical problems, improving developer workflows, and building things that real people use.

I enjoy understanding how systems fit together — from UI to database to deployment. I like clean, maintainable code and products that solve real problems. And yes, I still believe coffee → code ☕➡️💻
